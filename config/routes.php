/**
 * This file contains the route name mappings for the API routes.
 * It allows for a more flexible and consistent naming of routes
 * in the application. Instead of hardcoding route names directly
 * in the route definition, they are fetched from this config file.
 *
 * Example Usage in routes/api.php:
 *
 * $routeNames = config('routes');
 * Route::post('/register', 'register')->name($routeNames['register']);
 *
 * Route names can be used for generating URLs, redirecting, or matching
 * route names throughout the application.
